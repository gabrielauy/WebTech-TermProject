			<p>What is a Paragraph?
				A paragraph is a group of sentences that convey an idea. Each sentence works together
				as part of a unit to create an overall thought or impression. A paragraph is the smallest
				unit or cluster of sentences in which one idea can be developed adequately. Paragraphs
				can stand alone or function as part of an essay, but each paragraph covers only one main
				idea.
				The most important sentence in your paragraph is the topic sentence, which clearly
				states the subject of the whole paragraph. The topic sentence is usually the first
				sentence of the paragraph because it gives an overview of the sentences to follow. The
				supporting sentences after the topic sentence help to develop the main idea. These
				sentences give specific details related to the topic sentence. A final or concluding
				sentence often restates or summarizes the main idea of the topic sentence.</p>
